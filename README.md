# Python Library for Reading IMD Files

This library allows reading of IMD format files. IMD files are disk images that follow the format
used by the IMD tool created by Dave Dunfield. This library uses the format as described in
[the manual](https://oldcomputers-ddns.org/public/pub/manuals/imd.pdf).

As noted in the license for IMD "[t]he disk image file format specification is hereby placed into
the public domain". Licensing of the format is therefore not a concern.
